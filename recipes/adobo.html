        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 pound chicken thigh fillets</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves(minced)</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>⅓ cup (85ml) soy sauce</li>
            <li>⅓ cup + 2 tablespoon of white vinegar</li>
            <li>4 bay leaves or 3 dried</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon of oil</li>
            <li>1 brown onion</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon whole black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at<br>
            least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tblespoon oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from<br>
            marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until<br>
            browned - about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the <br>
            way through.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 ½ minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to <br>
            a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes <br>
            (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce <br>
            reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.</li>
            <li>If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let <br>
            the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken<br>
            to the skillet to coat in the glaze.</li>
            <li>Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice.</li>
        </ol>
