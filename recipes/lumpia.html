        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lumpia are fried spring rolls that are found in Filipino and <br>
        Indonesian cuisines. The rolls traditionally feature a thin pastry<br>
        skin (a.k.a. a lumpia wrapper) and are often stuffed with a savory<br>
        mixture of ground pork and vegetables.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>½ cup minced carrots</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped green onions</li>
            <li>½ cup thinly sliced green cabbage</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>30 lumpia wrappers</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet <br>
            over high heat. Add pork; cook and stir until crumbly and no pink <br>
            is showing, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove pork from the pan and set aside.<br>
            Drain grease from the pan, leaving just a thin coating. </li>
            <li>Add onion and garlic to the pan; cook and stir until fragrant,<br>
            about 2 minutes. Stir in the cooked pork, carrots, green onions, <br>
            cabbage, and cilantro. Season with pepper, salt, garlic powder, and <br>
            soy sauce. Remove from the heat, and set aside until cool enough to <br>
            handle, about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Assemble lumpia: Place 3 heaping tablespoons of filling diagonally<br>
            near one corner of a lumpia wrapper, leaving a 1 1/2 inch space at both<br>
            ends. Fold the side along the length of the filling over the filling, <br>
            tuck in both ends, and roll neatly and tightly to close. Moisten the <br>
            other side of the wrapper with water to seal the edge. Transfer to a <br>
            plate and cover with plastic wrap to retain moisture. Repeat to <br>
            assemble remaining lumpia. </li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat for <br>
            5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Slide 3 to 4 lumpia into the hot oil, making sure the seams are <br>
            facing down. Fry, turning occasionally, until all sides are golden brown, <br>
            1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat to <br>
            fry remaining lumpia. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
