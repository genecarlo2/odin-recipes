            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a <br>
            Dutch oven medium heat until well browned.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, <br>
            and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, <br>
            1 tablespoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and <br>
            pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring <br>
            occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Cook <br>
            lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain <br>
            noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, <br>
            remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F(190 degrees C)</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the <br>
            bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles <br>
            lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta <br>
            cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.<br>
            Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle <br>
            with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and <br>
            Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either<br>
            spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not <br>
            touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil<br>
            and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
